    "corpus2 = [\"If there is a phrase I would prefer to retire from online bios, personal or professional, it is, I love travel. Or some approximation of that sentiment. To clarify, I am not against travellers or those who proudly flaunt their passion for travel. On the contrary, editing a travel magazine has now made me oddly protective of travellers and their ilk. My submission is that love to travel, suggested so casually, just doesn’t feel adequate to the depth of emotion it sparks in true devotees.In February, the month of love as endowed by our great gifting industrial complex, we are wrestling with what love for travel means in tangible, life-affecting terms. The early throes of discovering travel might not be too dissimilar to the beginnings of a feverish affair. A fleeting scene, sound or feeling that at first arouses, then enchants and eventually, lures us into a hypnotic state, evoking woolly-eyed reveries about what could be.This world, however, is not the most conducive for long-term passion, the kind that demands unflinching sustenance in the midst of distractions from a thousand notifications. Passion has many rivals to contend with. And in flippantly announcing travel as our first love, we are not fully considering the influence our other paramours (work, relationships or money) exert on us.Travellers for life are compulsive. They have to be; there is no other existence. Climate change, marriages, deaths, protests and politics might have to take a backseat. I am reminded of a wanderlust-happy couple that discovered chinks in their relationship during a road trip through Russia. The woman, upset and distraught, offered a solution: cut the trip short to come back home and rekindle their chemistry. The man, however, wouldn’t give up Siberia, despite a chance at a do-over. Please don’t go getting any ideas about breaking hearts but for some travellers, marital bliss too has its limits.In finding stories about travel as a lifetime affair, we looked for longevity. We chose accounts of love, which tempered by the prospect of actually living, may have assumed a subdued tenor. But it only took a remembrance or flicker to fan the ardour all over again. One budding artist writes of her admiration for Frida Kahlo, and a Frida-inspired pilgrimage to Mexico. One of our own staffers takes a mental journey back to the cities and countries that have bookmarked her blossoming long-distance affection while a mountaineer outlines why the solitude of the Himalayas will never fail to captivate her.Falling in love with travel is much like falling in love with a song. You wear it out until it makes you sick. But you have to be foolish and always full of song.\",\"Leaning out from a bridge leading into Wat Rong Khun, I squint at a stucco moat of outstretched hands and grisly skeletons. Two massive horns arch over the walkway, while a few steps ahead, giant statues of Death and Rahu guard the entrance, like burly bouncers poised to restrict my entry into heaven. “The bridge of rebirth,” I overhear a foreign couple talking. A swampland of desire—enslaved arms—lie in wait blocking a mortal’s road to nirvana. This was rebirth as an infernal spectre, not Elton John’s PG-13 “Circle of Life.”Chiang Rai’s White Temple could stand in for a gonzo Disney dream, a lakeside monument studded with fragmented mirrors blinking from every inch. Artist Chalermchai Kositpipat, its eccentric creator, draws heavily from manic surrealism. He also loves allegory. White signifies the Buddha’s purity; glass denotes his luminosity. The bridge opens into a vast main complex, a safe space for souls free of want. Besides the usual aspects of a shrine, I saunter past some oddball touches—replicas of Iron Man, ghouls hanging from trees and a golden lavatory.Inside the temple’s principal hall, Kositpipat’s unleashes his freakish vision to the hilt in imposing Buddhist murals, spiked with late 1990s/early 2000s mainstream culture and fired through a space cannon. My eyes scan cosmic battles, the Twin Towers aflame, Neo from The Matrix, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and the notorious big Bs (Bush and Bin Laden). It’s symbolism in overdrive. Not far from here the souvenir shop hawks these mural scenes on smaller prints. I make a beeline for it. Seeking a want, you might rightly deduce. My soul shrugs as the bridge beckons.\",\"As soon as a long, gleaming dark green train carriage, emblazoned with ‘Eastern & Oriental Express’ in engraved gold lettering slides into Hua Hin station, I feel a tinge of self-consciousness. Neither I nor my co-passengers from India are dressed for something this imperial. For the last hour, we have been milling about Hua Hin, Thailand’s oldest railway station—a quirky but fading royal artefact—in our baggy tees, jeans and dusty shoes, lugging backpacks and satchels. Once I hop aboard the train though, the air is less intimidating. While this is a majestic luxury locomotive boasting every accoutrement of refined sophistication, I see open, friendly faces in casual wear and summer hats.To be clear, our group is not actually travelling on the E&O Express, presently journeying between Singapore and Bangkok. We are only passing through, being shown around for a brief period by a senior manager in an impeccable grey suit. Launched in the 1990s, the Express’s carriages originally belonged to another train called the Silver Star, but they have now been refitted to reflect Indochina’s fine artistry and its Western past. We are in the train’s bar area, where both style elements compete for attention: the walls and flooring appear to evoke a colonial-era, upper-class gentlemen’s club with tanned teak wood panels. And then, there are more decorative finishes, which nod to Asian designs, from the train’s silken upholstery to its intricate marquetry on furnishings. Outside, Hua Hin’s landscape scrolls by, framed by windows, like a scene from a TV screen. The comfortable sofa-style seating is separated in the middle by a compact side table with an antique lamp. Reclining in one of the seats, I sense the appeal of spending a few hours catching a snooze with a half-read paperback resting on my lap.\",\"After a tiring snorkelling session in the clear waters of Koh Phangan, instructors Captain Pumpui and Captain Poo are shepherding me and five others on a private speedboat to nearby Bottle Beach for a picnic lunch of sandwiches, macarons and fruit juices. I am about 10-12 kilometres from Belmond Napasai’s lush tropical resort in Koh Samui, my home for the last day-and-a-half, and the sun is blindingly bright overhead. This is ideal snorkelling weather; we have had a field day gasping at eels and corals underwater. But the heat has stymied chatter on our boat.However, the aquamen on board won’t have any lull. Blasting dance numbers from the speakers, Pumpui swivels his hips throughout the ride, Shakira-style, exhorting us to join in. We muster a few, muted rhythmic claps. Sometimes he pulls faces through a snorkel mask and, in another instant, casually hangs from outside the boat window like an impertinent daredevil. When Pumpui tires, he steers the boat and Poo takes over as cheerleader. I crack a bemused smile at their relentlessly sunny Laurel & Hardy routine. Perhaps every resort should have a slapstick comedy pairing on hand to liven up spirits.\"]"

For years, Mount Everest inspired a sense of forbidden majesty, which was surmounted only by a few courageous adventurers. It helped that they were entertaining and we were content to immerse ourselves in the stories they wove from these monumental expeditions.In 2019, life-changing experiences are more easily found. This is probably why, when a photo of tourists lined up outside Everests summit, as though it were some check-in counter at an airport dispensing visas, was widely debated three months ago, the overwhelming emotion was deflated acceptance. No one in this day and age will be denied their Edmund Hillary moment.In February, the New York Times ran a panicked headline about another solitary paradise, which had long been removed from sustained tourist interference—the Galápagos. “Going to the Galápagos Is Easier and Cheaper Than Ever. That Might Not Be a Good Thing,” it warned. According to the article, “in 2017, 2,41,800 people visited the islands, up from 1,73,419 a decade earlier.”\"]\n",
